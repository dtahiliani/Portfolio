### Sendgrid Server Performance Monitoring Project

One of the things we needed to be careful with while migrating to a new email platform was the reputation of our server. A decent indicator I monitored the spead at which our emails were being sent. 

## Phase I

a more manual version, where the data for each plot was made by hand. 

### Data Collection

Data collection at this time continues to be done manually

## Phase II

creates the necessary masks and plots by evaluating unique values of the individual email name. (clever code that writes code)
